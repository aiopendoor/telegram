**GIIP Agent System** is an agent created by independently extracting only the **Autonomous Multi-Agent Framework** designed for complex software development and task automation.

You can build your own agent system by modifying the contents of the roles according to your know-how and purpose.

Basically, it provides a state-of-the-art AI workflow where the Opendoor and specialized sub-agents collaborate utilizing the Google Gemini API.
If you don't use the Google Gemini API, you can use it manually at a low cost. And if you want to use another API, just instruct the opendoor, and it will change it to suit your environment.

This framework adopts the concept of **Role-based Sub-Agents** similar to **Claude Code's skills** or **OpenCode**, elaborately dividing and solving complex tasks.

Specifically designed and optimized for the **Antigravity Tool**, it runs immediately with existing development tools and PowerShell environments without installing separate third-party tools. It provides excellent stability and compatibility even in Electron-based terminal environments.

It is optimized for the Korean Developer Ecosystem, and all processes and documentation follow the **Korean-First** principle.


## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Role-based collaboration in the style of Claude Code/OpenCode.
- **Superpowers Native**: Built-in advanced engineering skills such as Plan, TDD, and Systematic Debugging.
- **Multi-Platform Ready**: Immediately compatible with various AI tools such as Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude.
- **Autonomous Development**: Autonomous task performance from requirement analysis to implementation and verification.

- **Zero-Tool Setup**: Immediately usable in the existing PowerShell environment without additional tool installation.
- **Environment Stability**: Works perfectly in an Electron-based PowerShell environment.
- **Gemini API Native**: High-performance reasoning and code generation utilizing the latest Google Gemini model.
- **Korean-First Workflow**: Optimized for Korean-based documentation and agent interaction.
- **React Best Practices**: Optimized Frontend code generation by applying Vercel's React Best Practices Rules.
- **Bkit Vibecoding Kit**: Provides systematic development and Bkit feature usage reporting based on PDCA methodology.

This repository is a space for managing the settings, role definitions, and workflows of the GIIP AI Agent system.

Since only the definitions of the roles for sub-agents actually used or necessary functions are collected in the `.agent` folder, overwriting the contents of this repository onto an existing project will not affect the existing project.

After copying the files and directories of this repository to the folder you are working in, start antigravity. Then, the preparation is finished by entering the chat as follows.

```
You are the opendoor. Check your role, analyze the tasks below, and delegate the work to each person in charge.
If there is no appropriate role to delegate, create a new role and delegate it to the person in charge.

-- Task Details --

```

Now you will be able to give work instructions in the current chat screen.

## 🤝 Compatibility

This project supports various AI agent environments:
- **Antigravity**: `GEMINI.md` automatic recognition
- **Cursor / Windsurf**: `.cursorrules` automatic recognition
- **GitHub Copilot**: `COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` automatic recognition
- **Claude / OpenCode**: Easy setup through `SETUP_AGENTS.md` guide

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To use this system, the following tools must be installed:

1. **PowerShell 7+**: [Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows)
2. **Node.js**: LTS version is recommended from the [official site](https://nodejs.org/).
3. **Gemini CLI**: Run the following command in the terminal to install globally.
   ```powershell
   npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
   ```

## ⚙️ Setup & Configuration

### 1. API Key Setting
Setting an API Key is necessary to use the Gemini API.
(Not required if using manual start only.)

First, if you ask the antigravity tool to analyze the agent script and create a setting.json sample file, the file will be created.

1. Get an API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Copy the `.agent/settings.json.sample` file in the project root to `settings.json` in the same folder.
3. Open the copied `settings.json` file and replace the `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` part with the actual key issued.

> [!NOTE]
> The `launch_subsession.ps1` script first checks `.agent/settings.json` within the project, and if it doesn't exist, it refers to the user's home directory (`~/.gemini/settings.json`).

## 📁 Directory Structure

```text
.agent/
├── roles/          # Persona and responsibility definitions for each agent (Developer, Tester, etc.)
├── dispatch/       # Task definition files (TASK_YYYYMMDD-ID.md)
├── scripts/        # [PowerShell script tools for system operation](./.agent/scripts/README.md)
├── work_history/   # Record of work history (Rule compliance)
└── README.md       # System detailed guide
```

## 🚀 Basic Usage

There are two ways to start a sub-agent session in the background after giving a command. You must execute one of the two for the sub-agents of each role to start work.

### 1. Automatic Start (when using gemini-cli)
Automatically detects pending tasks and starts a `gemini-cli` session with the appropriate role immediately.
```powershell
.\.agent\scripts\launch_subsession.ps1
```

- Periodic automatic execution (using batch file)
You can set the agent to automatically check every 5 minutes and perform tasks.
```cmd
.\auto_agent.bat
```
This script maintains the running window and repeatedly calls `launch_subsession.ps1` at 5-minute (300-second) intervals.

### 2. Manual Start (Clipboard Handoff)
Used when you want to paste work into a new session in an environment such as Agent Manager without `gemini-cli`. It finds pending tasks and copies the context of the relevant role to the clipboard.
```powershell
.\.agent\scripts\launch_role.ps1
```
After execution, start the work by pasting it with `Ctrl+V` in the window chatting with the agent. (Creating a new conversation (plus button on the left) in the agent manager and pasting it is the most certain way.)

## 📊 Monitoring & Status
Check the progress of all tasks and currently running background processes.
```powershell
.\.agent\scripts\check_status.ps1
```

### 3. Check Work History
All work history of the agents is recorded by date in the `work_history` directory.

## 🚨 Core Principles
All agents strictly adhere to the following rules:
1.  **Evidence First**: Technical basis is always presented by linking as a markdown file.
2.  **Korean First**: In principle, all outputs and documents are written in Korean. (Note: This README is an English version for global compatibility).
3.  **Clean Code**: Write code that is highly readable and easy to maintain, and eliminate unnecessary duplication.

## 🔄 Agent Workflow

    A[User Request] --> B[Opendoor: Task Creation]
    B --> C[launch_subsession.ps1 execution]
    C --> D[Specialized Agent: Task Execution]
    D --> E[Verify and Complete Task]
    E --> F[Opendoor: Final Report]
```

1.  The **Opendoor** analyzes the request and creates a task in the `dispatch` directory.
2.  The user or system executes `launch_subsession.ps1`.
3.  The **Sub-Agent** (e.g., Developer, Tester) performs the work and updates the status to `Completed`.
4.  The **Opendoor** verifies the final output.

## 📦 Bkit Vibecoding Kit Integration

**Bkit** is a Vibecoding Kit that combines the PDCA (Plan-Design-Do-Check-Act) methodology with an agent workflow to maximize development efficiency and quality.

- **PDCA Loop**: Systematic development process management through commands such as `/pdca plan`, `/pdca design`, and `/pdca analyze`.
- **Gap Analysis**: Automatically analyzes the difference between implementation and design to ensure quality.
- **Automated Reporting**: Provides standardized reporting on all work results.

See [.gemini/README.md](.gemini/README.md) or [GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md) for detailed usage.

## 🦸 Superpowers Integration

This framework embeds the [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) system to make the agent act like a **responsible engineer** rather than a simple coding machine.

- **Subagent Driven Development**: Processes one complex task through a 3-step pipeline: `Implementation` -> `Spec Review` -> `Code Quality Review`.
- **Writing Plans**: Validates the design by writing `implementation_plan.md` before touching the code.
- **Test Driven Development (TDD)**: Writes defect-free code through the `Red` -> `Green` -> `Refactor` cycle.
- **Systematic Debugging**: Resolves the root cause with hypothesis-verification debugging rather than random modifications.
